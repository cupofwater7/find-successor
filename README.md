# find-successor

Difficulty: medium

  Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree (where nodes have an additional
  pointer to their parent node) as well as a node contained in that tree and
  returns the given node's successor. A node's successor is the next node to be visited (immediately after the given
  node) when traversing its tree using the in-order tree-traversal technique. A
  node has no successor if it's the last node to be visited in the in-order
  traversal. If a node has no successor, your function should return None / null.
  Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a parent node, a left child node, and a
  right child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.
